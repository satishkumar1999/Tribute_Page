                <!-- <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2> -->
                <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) 
                    was an Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the
                     development of India's missile and nuclear 
                    weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.Kalam earned a 
                    degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 
                    1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved 
                    to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, 
                    the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining
                     DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,
                      which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s 
                      first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated 
                    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>
